# Hardware Assembly

This guide will walk you through assembling the EnergyMe device case. This is **safe for everyone** - no electrical work is involved at this stage.

## What You'll Need

From your EnergyMe box:

- 1 Electronic board
- 1 Gray upper case part
- 1 Gray lower case part
- 1 Black fixing clip
- 1 Transparent window
- 1 Current transformer (CT) 50A/333mV
- 3 Current transformers (CT) 30A/333mV

## Step 1: Prepare the Upper Case

At this point, you should have the rectangular hole for the black clip facing downward.

## Step 3: Attach the Bottom Case
